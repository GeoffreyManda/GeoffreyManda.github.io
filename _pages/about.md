Hello, thank you for stopping by. 
<br/>

My name is Geoffrey Manda, I am an infectious disease modeller and epidemiologist and passionate about data analysis in health-related research.
Many diseases and advserse health outcomes are preventable and, or treatable - that is what drives me in my work. 
I am widely interested in using quantitative tools, from data analysis to find influencing factors for a health/disease outcome, 
to simulation modeling to project likely impact of interventions in a population. 

Most of my experience has been in child health specifically in paediatric cancer. Recently I have shifted my attention to malaria research in Sub-Saharan Africa. My international (in-country) work experience includes Belgium, Malawi and Tanzania.

Currently I continue my doctoral research at the [Malaria research group](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/global-health-institute/)) within the Global health Institute at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. I hold an M.Sc.'s degree in Public Health from the [London School of Hygiene and tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) and a bachelor degree in Medicine and Surgery from [the university of malawi, College of Medicine](https://www.kuhes.ac.mw)
