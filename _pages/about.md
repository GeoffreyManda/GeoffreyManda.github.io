## About Me
I am Geoffrey Manda, a dedicated and multidisciplinary professional with a passion for improving healthcare outcomes through the use of statistical analysis, data science, and various public health initiatives. I am a passionate and inquisitive team player who has great initiative and a willing learner. My true passion is travelling, and I love learning about other cultures and languages. This website serves as a comprehensive showcase of my academic journey, professional experiences, research contributions, and more. I am originally from Malawi and have had the privilege of pursuing a diverse educational background.

## Professional Journey
My journey has taken me across continents and through various roles. From serving as a Medical Officer at Texas Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Malawi to contributing as an Independent Consultant for the World Health Organization, I've been involved in impactful projects addressing severe acute malnutrition and pediatric oncology. My professional interests lie in paediatric and child health research specifically infectious diseases, undernutrition and childhood cancers. I am obsessed about health-related research as it is a critical tool that generates empirical data for informing health policy for the betterment of all. My international (in-country) work experience includes Belgium, Malawi, the United Kingdom, and Tanzania. I am widely interested in using quantitative tools, from data analysis to find influencing factors for a health/disease outcome, to simulation modeling to project likely impact of interventions in a population. Most of my prior experience has been in child health specifically in paediatric cancer and recently I have shifted my attention to malaria research in Sub-Saharan Africa. I am currently, a doctoral fellow focusing on infectious disease modelling and epidemiology within the [Malaria research group in the Global health Institute](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/global-health-institute/) at [the University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) in Belgium.

## Teaching, Research and Publications
Diving into the world of research, I've actively contributed to evidence synthesis and statistical analysis, resulting in several peer-reviewed publications. These cover topics ranging from Nutrition, cancer, injuries and infectious diseases. Importantly I am a passionate educator and together with a fellow PhD fellow I have conducted R workshops in for master of epidemiology students at at [the University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) and I am a volunteer data analyst at [frontier innovators global](https://www.frontier-innovators-global.github.io), a health focused think tank based in Lilongwe, Malawi.
