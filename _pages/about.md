Hello, thank you for stopping by. 
<br/>

My name is Geoffrey Manda. I am a passionate and inquisitive team player who has great initiative and a willing learner. My true passion is travelling, and I love learning about other cultures and languages. My professional interests lie in paediatric and child health research specifically infectious diseases, undernutrition and childhood cancers. I am obsessed about health-related research as it is a critical tool that generates empirical data for informing health policy for the betterment of all. 

My international (in-country) work experience includes Belgium, Malawi, the United Kingdom, and Tanzania. I am widely interested in using quantitative tools, from data analysis to find influencing factors for a health/disease outcome, to simulation modeling to project likely impact of interventions in a population. Most of my prior experience has been in child health specifically in paediatric cancer and recently I have shifted my attention to malaria research in Sub-Saharan Africa. I am currently, a doctoral fellow focusing on infectious disease modelling and epidemiology within the [Malaria research group in the Global health Institute](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/global-health-institute/) at [the University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) in Belgium.

Importantly I am a passionate educator and together with a fellow PhD fellow I have conducted R workshops in for master of epidemiology students at at [the University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) and I am a volunteer data analyst at [frontier innovators global](https://www.frontier-innovators-global.github.io), a health focused think tank based in Lilongwe, Malawi. I hold an M.Sc.'s degree in Public Health from the [London School of Hygiene and tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) and a bachelor degree in Medicine and Surgery from [the university of malawi, College of Medicine](https://www.kuhes.ac.mw)
