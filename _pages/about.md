<br/>
Hello, thank you for stopping by. 
<br/>

My name is Manuela Runge, I am an infectious disease epidemiologist and passionate about data analysis in health-related research.
Many diseases and advserse health outcomes are preventable and, or treatable - that is what drives me in my work. 
I am widely interested in using quantitative tools, from data analysis to find influencing factors for a health/disease outcome, 
to simulation modeling to project likely impact of interventions in a population. 

Most of my experience has been in malaria research in Sub-Saharan Africa, while I also have worked on projects related to COVID-19, West-Nile-Virus and Measles. 
My international (in-country) work experience includes Germany, Switzerland, Tanzania, and the US. 


Currently I continue my postdoctoral research at the [NU malaria modeling group](https://www.numalariamodeling.org/) at Northwestern University, Chicago, USA as an external contractor working remotely from Switzerland.
I hold a Ph.D. and M.Sc.'s degree in Epidemiology from the [Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/) and University of Basel, Switzeland.
I received a B.Sc. in [Health Sciences at the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/university/faculty-of-life-sciences/departments/health-sciences/).
