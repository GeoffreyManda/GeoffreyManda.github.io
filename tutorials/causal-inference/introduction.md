    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to this comprehensive PhD-level tutorial series on causal inference in epidemiology. This course provides a structured approach to understanding and applying causal inference methods in epidemiological research, covering theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, practical applications, and interactive programming exercises.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Causal inference represents one of the most fundamental and challenging aspects of epidemiological research. This tutorial series goes beyond association studies to explore how researchers can make valid causal claims from observational data, incorporate experimental designs, and address the complex issues of confounding, selection bias, and measurement error that complicate causal analyses.
