Atrial myxomas are very rare but should be considered in any patient presenting with heart failure. The diagnosis of atrial myxoma can be elusive, especially when the symptoms are non-specific. Although easily treated in the western world, surgical intervention is not widely available in Malawi and most regions of Africa13. We recommend an echocardiogram in the workup of heart failure of unknown aetiology to facilitate earlier identification of intra-cardiac growths for timely intervention. The unfortunate outcome of this case (patient death) highlights that young, otherwise healthy, Malawian patients are dying from easily treatable cardiac diseases because of the lack of cardiac surgery in Malawi.
