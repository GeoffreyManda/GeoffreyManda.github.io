AAA, though uncommon, should be considered in any patient presenting with abdominal and lower back pains. The diagnosis of AAA can be elusive, especially when the symptoms are non-specific particularly in early phase leading to considerable diagnostic delays by non-suspecting clinicians. We recommend abdominal imaging with basic modalities like ultrasonography in the workup of abdominal pain of undifferentiated aetiology to facilitate earlier identification of these vascular problems which can timely inform definitive management. Even in the absence of EVAR, open repair remains a safe and durable option for the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
