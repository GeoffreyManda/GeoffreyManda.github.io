The OpenMalaria model of malaria dynamics was calibrated for all 184 councils in mainland Tanzania using data from malaria indicator surveys, school parasitaemia surveys, entomological surveillance, and vector control deployment data. 
The methodology reported in this work is based on intensive interactions with the NMCP and provides a helpful tool for assessing the feasibility of 
country specific targets and for determining which intervention stratifications at sub-national level will have most impact. This country-led application 
could support strategic planning of malaria control in many other malaria endemic countries.
