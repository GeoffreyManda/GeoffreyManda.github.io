Implementing a curative resource-adapted treatment protocol in an extremely resourced-constrained environment was feasible in Malawi and resulted in relatively favorable outcomes in low-stage disease, particularly among those who completed therapy. However, factors such as late-stage disease, frequent abandonment, and absent radiotherapy represent ongoing implementation barriers that should be the focus of continued research funding and intervention in Africa.
