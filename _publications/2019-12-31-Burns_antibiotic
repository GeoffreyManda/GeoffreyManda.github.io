The result of our preliminary study points towards nosocomial gram-negative bacteria which appear on the World Health Organisations list of priority pathogens as the more common sources of antimicrobial resistance. This scenario is potentially driven by inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions as well as clinical and laboratory diagnostic imprecision in addition to the universally recognised post burn pathophysiological changes of hypermetabolism and immunosuppression. Improvements in the areas of antimicrobial stewardship, diagnostic capacity and burns related research are needed in order to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes and resource utilisation.
