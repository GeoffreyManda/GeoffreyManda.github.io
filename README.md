I am a passionate and inquisitive team player who has great initiative and a willing learner. My true passion is travelling, and I love learning about other cultures and languages. My professional interests lie in child health specifically infectious diseases and childhood cancers. In 2021, I received my Public Health Masters at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and prior to that I received my medical degree at the University of Malawi, College of Medicine. I have been collaborating closely with the National Malaria Control Programme in Tanzania Ministry of Health to build computational models for malaria infectious diseases and conduct cost-effectiveness and feasibility studies. Importantly I am a passionate educator and together with a fellow PhD fellow I have conducted R workshops for master of epidemiology students at the University of Antwerp.
