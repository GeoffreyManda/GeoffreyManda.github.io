In this work I supported management of data data collected through Newborn Essential Solutions and Technologies (NEST360), a programme aimed at reducing newborn mortality by implementing a co-created health systems package with governments. Health Facility Assessment (HFA) and neonatal inpatient data (NID) from 65 NEST360-implementing facilities in Malawi, Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria, were also analysed focusing on service readiness for inpatient small and sick newborn care in four African countries. During this assignment I also supported the development of [the toolkit for small and sick newborns](https://www.newborntoolkit.org/) in collaboration with [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org) and other key playersin the [NEST Alliance](https://nest360.org/about/). This toolkit brings together knowledge, experiences, resources, and learnings for implementing small and sick newborn care services.
