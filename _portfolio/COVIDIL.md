We will identify models of within-host dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum that have been fitted to parasite density profiles from malaria therapy patients, and simulations of P. falciparum epidemiology fitted to field malariologic datasets from a large ensemble of settings across Africa. We will use this models to assess the relative and absolute contribution of schoolchildren (6-12 yrs) on malaria transmission in different malaria endemic settings taking into account the (effectiveness of) other interventions. Our model outputs also supported selecting of interventions like IPTsc in isolation or in combination with other disease control interventions.

The model and analysis script will be published in the public GitHub repository  [here]().
