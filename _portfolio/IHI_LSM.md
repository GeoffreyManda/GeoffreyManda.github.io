My masters thesis focused on exploratory spatial analysis of neonatal mortality in Malawi. This study analyzed the spatial clustering and risk factors of neonatal mortality across 26 health facilities in malawi where [NEST360](https://nest360.org) is currently implementing a number of innovations to reduce neonatal morality. These innovations include new technologies, health-system improvements and improving local research capacity. The objectives of the study were to qualify the magnitude, identify significant determinants, as well as to assess for spatial autocorrelation across the district and sub-district geographical areas and identify areas called “hot spots” characterized by higher-than-normal NM in all studied areas in Malawi. Speficically, I created statististical maps and utilised montecarlo methods to test hypotheses of spatial autocorelation using moran I statistics and variogram based methods.
