Launched in 2017 in partnership with the Baylor College of Medicine International Pediatric AIDS Initiative Network and supported by a $50 million foundational investment from Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation, the [Texas Children’s Global HOPE (Hematology-Oncology Pediatric Excellence)](https://www.texaschildrensglobalhealth.org/global-hope) program is strengthening local healthcare infrastructure, in partnership with local Ministries of Health, and building capacity to effectively provide the multi-disciplinary care that is needed to optimally care for children with cancer. Between 2018 and 2020, I worked as a clinical researcher and had important professional development opportunities.
